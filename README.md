# Group 5 - ComeHome

## Background 
As globalisation grows, more young people move abroad to study and work. For example, international students may struggle to share their well-being in real-time, while parents feel anxious due to limited updates. This can be quite emotional and leave both feeling isolated. Our device aims to bridge this gap in a way that sets it apart from a standard phone.
